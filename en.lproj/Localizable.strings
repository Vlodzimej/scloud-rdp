- Login to Proxmox, oVirt or RHEV through its Web interface
- Find your VM and click on its Console to download a console .vv file
- Tap or click on the downloaded console file and aSPICE will launch to show you the remote console

Libvirt/Qemu KVM
- If your mouse pointer is not in sync with where you tap, you may need to add an 'EvTouch USB Graphics Tablet' to your virtual machine (when it's powered off) and then power it on. To add the Tablet:
- If configuring through virt-manager, Go to the View->Details section, and select Add Hardware->Input->EvTouch USB Graphics Tablet.
- If running your virtual machine on the command-line, you need an option similar to: '-device usb-tablet,id=input0'
